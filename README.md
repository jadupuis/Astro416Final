This repo contains the notebook, quasar dataset, and spectra for each quasar used in my Astro 416 Final. The notebook consists of 4 sections. The first section contains the code taken from my reserch that was used to properly read in the data and do some feature engineering. The second section contains the code used for the initial results of the model. The third section contains the code used for the final results of the model, and the forth section contains the code used for the kNN cross validation of the model. Each section is labeled properly with comments placed within each cell, stating more specificially what is happening at each step. The file titled GO-12289 target table-all.csv contains information about the quasars, including name, redshift, and the COS filename. The files whose title begins with HST are the actual files of all the COS spectra that are listed in the target table. These files contain the wavelength, flux, and error of the spectra.
